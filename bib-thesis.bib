	Abstract = {Self-contextualizability refers to the system ability to autonomously adapt its behaviour to context in order to maintain its objectives satisfied. In this paper, we propose a modeling framework to deal with self-contextualizability at the requirements level. We use Tropos goal models to express requirements; we provide constructs to analyse and represent context at each variation point of the goal model; and we exploit the goal and context analysis to define how the system satisfies its requirements in different contexts. Tropos goal analysis provides constructs to hierarchically analyse goals and discover alternative sets of tasks the system can execute to satisfy goals; our framework extends Tropos goal model by considering context at its variation points, and provides constructs to hierarchically analyse context and discover alternative sets of facts the system has to monitor to verify a context. A self-contextualizable promotion information system scenario is used to illustrate our approach.},

	Abstract = {Requirements evolution is a main driver for systems evolution. Traditionally, requirements evolution is associated to changes in the users' needs and environments. In this paper, we explore another cause for requirements evolution: assumptions. Requirements engineers often make assumptions stating, for example, that satisfying certain sub-requirements and/or correctly executing certain system functionalities would lead to reach a certain requirement. However, assumptions might be, or eventually become, invalid. We outline an approach to monitor, at runtime, the assumptions in a requirements model and to evolve the model to reflect the validity level of such assumptions. We introduce two types of requirements evolution: autonomic (which evolves the priorities of system alternatives based on their success/failure in meeting requirements) and designer-supported (which detects loci in the requirements model containing invalid assumptions and recommends designers to take evolutionary actions).},

	Abstract = {The usefulness of a system specification depends on the completeness of the requirements specified. Unfortunately it is difficult to ensure a requirements specification includes all necessary requirements, especially when the system interacts with an unpredictable and often idealized environment. Worse yet, a single completeness counterexample may not clearly indicate the extent that incomplete requirements impacts the system or what range of environmental scenarios are affected. This paper introduces Ares-EC, a design-time approach for detecting incomplete requirements decomposition using a combination of evolutionary computation and symbolic analysis of hierarchical requirements models to detect a set of representative incompleteness counterexamples. We illustrate our approach by applying Ares-EC to a requirements model of an industry-based automotive adaptive cruise control system. Ares-EC is able to apply symbolic analysis and evolutionary computation to automatically detect diverse and representative sets of requirements incompleteness counterexamples at design time.},

	Abstract = {Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) approaches have been developed to facilitate the requirements engineers work by, for example, providing abstraction mechanisms to help eliciting and modeling requirements. One of the well-established GORE approaches is KAOS. Nevertheless, in large-scale systems building KAOS models may result in incomplete and/or complex goal models, which are difficult to understand and change. This may lead to an increase in costs of product development and evolution. Thus, for large-scale systems, the effective management of complexity and completeness of goal models is vital. In this paper, we propose a metrics framework for supporting the quantitative assessment of complexity and completeness of KAOS goal models. Those metrics are formally specified, implemented and incorporated in a KAOS modeling tool. We validate the metrics with a set of real-world case studies and discuss the identified recurring modeling practices.},

	Abstract = {Two approaches are presented for integrating formal and informal requirements specification languages by using Structured Analysis (SA) and the Vienna Development Method (VDM) as surrogates. The cognitive approach uses SA specifications as an aid to human understanding and cognition. This helps the requirements engineer develop top-level specifications of a system using the formal VDM specification language. SA then guides the stepwise refinement of the VDM specifications. The benefits of the cognitive approach include precision, unambiguity, provability, and error detection. However, the approach requires considerable human effort, thinking, and heuristics to develop a set of top-level and stepwise-refined VDM specification. The automated approach demonstrates the feasibility of interactive generation of VDM specifications of a system from an informal SA specification.},

@book{Cou06a,
	Abstract = {In response to a request from Congress, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the\nDepartment of Homeland Security sponsored a National Academies study to assess\nthe safety and security risks of spent nuclear fuel stored in cooling pools and dry\ncasks at commercial nuclear power plants. The information provided in this book\nexamines the risks of terrorist attacks using these materials for a radiological dispersal\ndevice. Safety and Security of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel is an unclassified public\nsummary of a more detailed classified book. The book finds that successful terrorist\nattacks on spent fuel pools, though difficult, are possible. A propagating fire in a\npool could release large amounts of radioactive material, but rearranging spent fuel\nin the pool during storage and providing emergency water spray systems would\nreduce the likelihood of a propagating fire even under severe damage conditions.\nThe book suggests that additional studies are needed to better understand these\nrisks. Although dry casks have advantages over cooling pools, pools are necessary at\nall operating nuclear power plants to store at least the recently discharged fuel. The\nbook explains it would be difficult for terrorists to steal enough spent fuel to construct\na significant radiological dispersal device.\n},

@article{Cai13a,
	Abstract = {Requirements completeness is among the most critical and difficult software engineering challenges. Missing requirements often result from poor risk analysis at requirements engineering time. Obstacle analysis is a goal-oriented form of risk analysis aimed at anticipating exceptional conditions in which the software should behave adequately. In the identify-assess-control cycles of such analysis, the assessment step is not well supported by existing techniques. This step is concerned with evaluating how likely the obstacles to goals are and how likely and severe their consequences are. Those key factors drive the selection of most appropriate countermeasures to be integrated in the system goal model for increased completeness. Moreover, obstacles to probabilistic goals are currently not supported; such goals prescribe that some corresponding target property should be satisfied in at least X {\%} of the cases. The paper presents a probabilistic framework for goal specification and obstacle assessment. The specification language for goals and obstacles is extended with a probabilistic layer where probabilities have a precise semantics grounded on system-specific phenomena. The probability of a root obstacle to a goal is thereby computed by up-propagation of probabilities of finer-grained obstacles through the obstacle refinement tree. The probability and severity of obstacle consequences is in turn computed by up-propagation from the obstructed leaf goals through the goal refinement graph. The paper shows how the computed information can be used to prioritize obstacles for countermeasure selection toward a more complete and robust goal model. A detailed evaluation of our framework on a non-trivial carpooling support system is also reported.},

Upon testing the performance of the system on various industrial case studies. HAZOPExpert was found to successfully mimic the human expert's reasoning and identify the hazards. But, with the increasing complexity of the processes, the HAZOPExpert system generated a large number of consequences compared to those identified by a team of experts. This is mainly due to the strict qualitative reasoning approach implemented in the HAZOPExpert system. In order to filter and rank the consequences generated by the HAZOPExpert system, a semi-quantitative reasoning methodology is proposed using additional quantitative knowledge in the form of design and operating specifications of the process units, and process material property values. This filtering approach combines the qualitative digraph-based HAZOP models and the quantitative knowledge to eliminate the unrealizable consequences. Significant reduction in the number of consequences was obtained using this approach on an ethylene process plant HAZOP case study.},

	Abstract = {Fault-tree technique has been used in industry for safety analysis of safety critical systems for decades. It can be used for analyzing the safety of both software and hardware. However, there are many problems with ensuring the internal consistency and validity of fault trees constructed because of the absence of appropriate approaches for using fault tree techniques. This article describes a model-oriented approach for safety analysis using fault trees. It advocates that a safety analysis of a system should start with a systematic study of the physical model of the system and, as a result, construct a system safety model based on the physical model. Further safety analysis of the system -- based on the system safety model by constructing fault trees -- is carried out. The internal consistency and consistency with the system safety model of these fault trees must be ensured. A prototype called FTSS (Fault Tree Support System) has been implemented by the ASAM (A Safety Argument Manager) project to support this approach and its functionality is described.},
